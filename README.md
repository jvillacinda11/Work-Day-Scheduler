# Work-Day-Scheduler
This is a planner type appliaction that tells the user the date and display time-blocks for the typical business hours. In the app the time-blocks will be color-coded as follows: past time-blocks will be colored grey, present will be red, and future will be colored green.in each time-block you will be able to input a task to be done in that hour. The user will be able to click the 'save' button to save all to-do items to localStorage. Lastly the 'clear' button at the bottom will delete all tasks from the localStorage and refresh the page to delete everything to make a clean slate!
